# qemu-source-patch

All the hard work has been made by DoomedRaven (https://github.com/doomedraven) 
In this repo https://github.com/doomedraven/Tools/blob/master/Virtualization/kvm-qemu.sh

What i made is just take all the patches for the source code from the script, and isolate them.
This way I justo clone the 2 repos (Qemu and Seabios) apply this patch and:
./configure
make

:)
